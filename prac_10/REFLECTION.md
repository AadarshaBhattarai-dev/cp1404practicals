# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was usually average. I would often underestimate tasks like debugging and getting used to new concepts.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy improved during the course of the subject because I recognised common errors and challenges and I started to understand
tasks better. I started adding extra time for testing and fixing errors.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to break tasks into smaller parts and have a more realistic approach about how long each step would actually take.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learned that other people have a better chance at spotting mistakes that I could miss and can also suggest ways to improve and rewrite my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I did not receive any request to complete a code review.

### Good Code Review 1

[N/A]()

### Good Code Review 2

[N/A]()

### Explanation

I did not receive any request to complete a code review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Even though there is already one quiz per week I would like to add more practice online quizzes. I think this would give us extra opportunities 
to check our understanding, practise key concepts and identify areas to improve before the next practical.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Even though I submitted two practicals late I took the extra time to make sure I understood the concepts properly and completed the tasks correctly.
I made sure to prioritise understanding the content and completing the practicals properly rather than rushing to meet the deadline.
